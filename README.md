## Instructions

To make this work for you, clone the repo, follow the instructions to update the backup then sync your changes with your repo.
Make sure to replace the URL from the Automatic Setup section.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is just an example, do not run this unless you want all my dotfiles and preferences. Make sure to backup your current dotfiles first.

Check dependencies:
```sh
git -v
```

Automatic setup:
```sh
mkdir ~/git
git clone https://github.com/jruaux/mac-setup.git ~/git/mac-setup
cd ~/git/mac-setup && sh main.sh
```

## Update the backup:
To update the backup to your own, just run 'backup.sh' from the project root directory. This will move your dotfiles (.zshrc and .config folder) to the project directory and create symlinks to your home folder. It will also back up all the brew packages into a Brewfile (homebrew must already be installed).

You only need to run this script once, now all your files will be managed in the mac-setup folder, so just update the remote branch to yours and push it to back it up.

## Manual settings

Some settings must be changed manually due to API limitation or lack of Apple documentation. Check [this issue](https://github.com/Jaycedam/mac-setup/issues/13) for more details.
